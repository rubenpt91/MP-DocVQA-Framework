Some  people are more affected by climate change than  others because of factors like where they live; their age, health, income, and occupation; and how they go about their day-to-day life  . Most women have healthy pregnancies and healthy  babies, However, climate change can worsen  environmental hazards that threaten the health of  pregnant women and increase health risks for the  baby, such as  :  Low weight of the baby at birth. If a baby weighs less than 5:5 pounds at birth, there may be lasting  effects on health.    Pre-term birt., Labor that starts before 37 weeks  of pregnancy is considered pre-term, and may lead  to health problems,   Air pollutants can cause respiratory illness in pregnant  women and also lead to low birth weight or pre-term  birth. Climate change worsens air quality because  warming temperatures make it easier for ground-level  ozone to form. Changing weather patterns and more  Intense and frequent wildfires also raise the amount of pollution, dust, and smoke in the air.  Climate change will also cause  extreme heat events  to become more frequent and  severe, which can lead to  dehydration and renal kidney) failure  Inpregnant women. Dehydration early  Inpregnancy can affect the baby's growth and later in pregnancy can cause pre-term birth. Under a changing climate, hurricane intensity and  rainfall are expected to increase and floods may occur  more often or be more severe. These types of extreme  Weather events increase health risks to pregnant  women. Poor nutrition and diarrhea from  contaminated water or food have been linked to  negative birth outcomes such as low birth weight. Floods can lead to an increase in exposure to to xins and mold. Severe weather events may damage homes, other buildings, and roads or require evacuations, which can make it more difficult for pregnant women  to.get the specialized health care they need  .     Physical outcomes related to environmental hazards are not the only concern for pregnant women, Pregnant women and women who have recently given  birth (postpartum) are at an increased risk for severe  stress and other negative mental health outcomes due to weather-related disasters associated with climate  change. Severe maternal stress can increase risk of. negative outcomes such as pre-term birth.
